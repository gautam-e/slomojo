This repo is inspired by fastaiâ€™s approach but does everything in Mojo
ðŸ”¥.

## Dependencies

We will use only the packages available in the Mojo Playground. Those
are:

- The Python standard library
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Content

We will progressively build an MNIST-handwritten-digits classifier:  
1. Read in the dataset from numpy  
2. Define a linear layer function  
3. Backprop from scratch
